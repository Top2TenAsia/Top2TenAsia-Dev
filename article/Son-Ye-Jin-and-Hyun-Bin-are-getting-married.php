								<p>2022 is going to be a year of full of surprises and gaining
new heights in every aspect. This year after Park Shin-hye and
Choi Tae-joon got married all of theirs fans were so excited
and considered it as one of the huge surprise of the year.<br><br>
But after that lovely couple surprised the world with their
wedding we have another k-drama couple (Son Ye-Jin and
Hyun Bin) who are going to surprise us this year after getting
married. This couple got a lot of attention and love after they
appeared as lead roles in one of the most loving and famous
Korean drama “crash landing on you”. Their fans were
shipping for them since they appeared in the drama and now
they are finally getting married in real life.<br><br>
This must be very promising and huge moment for both of
them as well as for their fans who always looked forward for
their romantic life. The couple is now set to tie the knot after
they went public with their relationship in early 2021.<br><br>
Son posted an image of a miniature ivory-white wedding
dress to Instagram with the accompanying caption: &quot;I
thought long and hard about how to share this story because
it&#39;s an important one.&quot; Without saying Hyun&#39;s name, she
wrote she had met someone to spend the rest of her life with.<br><br>

&quot;Yes, it&#39;s him... It happened so naturally... But, isn&#39;t that
destiny?&quot;<br><br>
&quot;Please help us celebrate the beginning of our future,&quot; she
added.<br><br>
Son&#39;s agency, MS Team, confirmed the news of the pair&#39;s
engagement in a press statement.<br><br>
&quot;They will have a wedding ceremony this coming March in
Seoul. As it is a difficult time for everyone due to the
pandemic, and according to the will of the two actors, the
event will be held privately,&quot; the statement read.
We all wish them a successful marriage life and look
forward for their wedding.</p>
