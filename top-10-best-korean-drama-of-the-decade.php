For Best Korean Drama 2014 we have Healer,When it comes to this drama Seems like I can't find enough words to describe the one of the best k-drama I've ever seen, what can i say, everything would be understatement, the acting, complex plot, sudden twists and turns, characters, OSTs and above all JI CHANG-WOOK, every damn thing is top notch in this show. The story set as a decade ago, an incident took place. It involves 5 friends who ran an illegal Citizens Radio Station. This incident brings back three different people together
Kim Mun-ho, a prominent reporter who had only one aim to find a girl who is probably a dead child and whom he doubted to be still alive. <button id="more6" onclick="MORE('more6', 'read6')" name="data" type="button" formnovalidate>Read more</button> <span id="read6" style="display: none">He wanted to protect that girl, so he ask Jung-hu(Healer) to find her and had to become a shield for her as some people want to kill her.  Jung-hu is an illegal night courier who works under the pseudonym of “Healer”.  He was known best in his field, not only he had the best hacker by his side and advanced technology but also had mind-blowing fighting skills. His supreme goal is to save money and buy an island off the coast and live there alone. But when he agrees to Kim Mun-ho to undertake his plan, he ultimately falls in love with Oh Ji Ha, whom he had to protect. Oh, Ji Ha was a quirky internet columnist who always dreamt to become a fabled reporter of all the time. But due to his abusive past, she traumatized and bears panic attacks whenever she saw violence around her. 
It was the KBS2 drama aired from Dec 2014 to Feb 2015 from 20 episodes. Nonetheless, this drama received modest ratings in the domestic region but also obtained so much love overseas. It made Ji Chang Wook even more popular overseas. <button id="less6" onclick="MORE('less6', 'read6')" name="data" type="button" formnovalidate>Read less</button> </span></span><br><span style="color:#e4405f">"People don’t have a long memory when it comes to other people’s affairs."<span style="color:coral;text-decoration:underline"> Healer</span></span>

This drama has everything literally everything, A story on family, friendship, school love life, financial crisis, good neighbors, lessons on life, You just had to named it. The story sets In 1988, five childhood friends who are also neighbors named Duk-Sun, Jung-Hwan, Sun-Woo, and Dong-Ryong are high school students and Taek is a genius go, player. All five of them have been together since their childhood. <button id="more5" onclick="MORE('more5', 'read5')" name="data" type="button" formnovalidate>Read more</button><span id="read5" style="display:none;">They all grew up playing and enjoying together and are neighbors to this day and also their families are very close to each other. They always enjoy and spend their time in Taek's room. Now for characters and cast Duk-Sun is the only girl in the five friend group and has a younger brother and an elder sister, her family is poor and they have been living in a semi-basement house.

Nevertheless, Duk-Sun is a cheerful girl with a bright personality who enjoys everything except for studies and She always gets into fights with her older sister Bo-Ra who is my crush.

Jung-Hwan's family is having plot they became rich overnight buy winning some lottery which Jung-Hwan's brother has purchased to try his luck and as for Jung-Hwan he really loved to play have a really family soccer. Sun-Woo is a perfect student at school, good at everything from study to sports he is a good son and good brother. Sun-Woo's father passed away when he was young and now he lives with his younger sister and mother. Dong-Ryong is the most amazing character I really loved him. He shares the same personality as Duk-Sun's and will surely make you laugh, his father is principal at the school in which Jung-Hwan, Sun-Woo, and Doog-Ryong studies. Taek is a famous go player known as God of the go and is well known in china, japan, and Korea. he dropped out of school so that he can play and focus on the go and due to this Duk-Sun, Jung-Hwan, Sun-Woo, and Dong-Ryong are his only friends.
