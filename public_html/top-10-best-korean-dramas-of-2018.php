Student president Choi SuJi (Moon Ga Young), Kwon SiHyun (Woo Do-hwan) eldest heir of the JK Group, and casanova Lee SeJu (Kim Min-jae) have been bestfriends since childhood. SuJi's current boyfriend, Lee KiYoung (Lee Jae-kyun) humiliates her and her mother for trying to use him to climb up the social ladder and breaks up with her. As the last straw, when SuJi's mother and SiHyun's father announce their engagement, the trio devise a plan to hit two birds with one stone.<br>
Eun TaeHee (Joy) is a hardworking female college student who no longer believes in love after watching the demise of her parents' marriage. SuJi finds out that TaeHee is KiYoung's first love, and asks SiHyun to seduce TaeHee and then break her heart, as a way to prove his loyalty to SuJi. After proving which, SuJi and SiHyun will get married to prevent their parents from doing so themselves.<br>
However, all does not go as planned, when SiHyun and TaeHee begin to actually fall for each other. The strain this puts on the trio's friendship, TaeHee's reaction after seeing their true faces and KiYoung's thirst for revenge make up the rest of this drama.

 Gangnam Beauty is a 2018 South Korean television series starring Im Soo-hyang, Cha Eun-woo, Jo Woo-ri and Kwak Dong-yeon. 
 Based on the webtoon of the same name published in 2016 by Naver WEBTOON,[3][4] it centers on the life of a college student who went 
 under cosmetic surgery to evade derision from her bullies, yet her decision seems to backfire as her peers ridicule her artificial look. 
 The title of the webtoon and of the TV series alludes to the Korean word gangnammiin (Gangnam beauty), a derogatory term in South Korea 
 for people who are attractive but look as if they went through a number of plastic surgeries for a pretty face, a hot body or both.

        Mr Sunshine takes a step back in time to show the complexities of the first US expeditions in
South Korea. Eugene Choi (Lee Byung-Hun), a Korean-born US Marine Corps soldier who fled
to America as a young slave boy, returns to his motherland on official duties, only to be
conflicted as he finds out that Korea is under threat of colonisation from foreign forces. Along
the way, Eugene meets an aristocrat’s daughter Go Ae-Sin (Kim Tae-Ri), which makes his
mission to prolong Joseon’s demise a mission to also protect those he holds close.
