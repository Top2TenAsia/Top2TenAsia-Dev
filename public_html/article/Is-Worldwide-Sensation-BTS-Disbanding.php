								<p>Worldwide famous South Korean boyband BTS who made their debut in
                                    2013 rule over millions of hearts in the world. BTS became famous
                                    world wildly after their dedication and hard work for their work. Every
                                    time this South Korean band BTS is the hot topic of the world. Recently
                                    BTS was in news about its disbanding? In recent Vlive BTS announces
                                    their break to focus in their solo project.<br><br>
                                    There fans (ARMY) got a wrong idea due to misinterpreted
                                    English word hiatus. After hearing the news, the Internet blew up with
                                    the news that BTS is disbanding but after some time their agency
                                    cleared the word hiatus to “to be clear, they are not in hiatus but will
                                    take time to explore some solo projects at this time and remain active in
                                    various different formats” the company said.<br><br>
                                    The clarification from the entertainment company came around
                                    3:00 AM and stated that they&#39;ll still be working on projects as a group
                                    as well as individually BTS are not taking a hiatus, member will be
                                    focusing more on solo projects at this time.<br><br>
                                    Due to the confusion of BTS disbanding their fans showed huge grief
                                    all over the Internet but they had a moment of relief after getting clear
                                    statement from their entertainment company that they are not
                                    disbanding but currently focusing on their solo projects more.<br><br>
                                    During the recent Vlive where BTS announced break from group
                                    projects they seemed very emotional at times. BTS discussed many
                                    issues during the live. BTS leader RM stated that a “the problem with k-
                                    pop and the whole ideal system is that it doesn&#39;t give you time to
                                    mature you have to keep producing music and keep doing something”.<br><br>
                                    RM also described groups most recent work by saying “I don&#39;t know
                                    what kind of group we were anymore I don&#39;t know what kind of story I
                                    
                                    should tell now”. Suga said “the hardest thing is writing lyrics nothing
                                    comes out and you can&#39;t force it I have to take talk about something
                                    that I really feel but right now I&#39;m just squeezing it out because we have
                                    to satisfy people&#39;s wants it is so painful but that&#39;s just how this job
                                    goes”. Jimin also stated that “I think that&#39;s why we are going through a
                                    rough patch right now we&#39;re trying to find our identity and that&#39;s
                                    exhausting and long process&quot;. J-hope also shared his thoughts by saying
                                    “I think that changes what we need right now it&#39;s an important part of
                                    BTS to start our second chapter”. The youngest member of the group
                                    jungkook also added that “we are each going to take some time to have
                                    fun and experience lots of things. We promise we will return someday
                                    even more mature than we are now. So I just hope that you could give
                                    us your blessings”. Other members of BTS also spoke their mind and
                                    seemed very emotional.<br><br>
                                    After hearing these statements from members of BTS we can predict
                                    how much pressured they must feel so it is best for them to have a
                                    break and take things slowly their fans support them equally and love
                                    them forever.</p>
