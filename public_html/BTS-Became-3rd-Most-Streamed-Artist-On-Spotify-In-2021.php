According to the Spotify Wrapped 2021 data, BTS
ranked third after Puerto Rican vocalist Bad Bunny and
Taylor Swift as the most-streamed artist globally, thanks to

its hit single &quot;Butter.&quot; Six of the 10 most-played K-pop songs

Dance&quot; and &quot;Life Goes On&quot; in the top four places.<br><br>
BTS also claimed nine of the top 10 most-streamed K-pop
albums with BLACKPINK in fourth place.<br><br>
&quot;We were able to confirm once again that Korean artists and their
music are loved worldwide,&quot; a Spotify official said. &quot;We&#39;ll continue to
support Korean artists so more of them can be connected with fans
around the world.&quot;
All BTS fans wish them luck and wish they get success every
