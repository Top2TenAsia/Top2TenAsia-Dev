This drama is one of the highly recommended drama from my girlfriend (now she is ex), who is of course a korean drama lover like me, that's why I choose her though 😂😂 but coming to serious topic yeah this drama is worth enough to be in the list of best korean drama on the decade, I really loved the cast of this drama their acting is amazing. The gradual growth of the characters were beautiful and their chemistry is just amazing.It's based on a coming-of-age story about a group of college athletes who are fighting for their dreams, experiencing and finding love in the process, and growing every step of the way.<br><span style="color:#e4405f">"believe in Myths if they give you hope and power to achieve your goal"</span>

         Fifteen years ago, a young girl was kidnapped on the way from school, and Park Hae Yeong, who was an elementary school student at that time, witnessed the crime. A few days later, the girl was found dead, and the police were not able to find the culprit. As time went by, Hae Yeong started distrusting the police. 
Fifteen years later, Hae Yeong is now a police officer and criminal profiler. One day, he finds a walkie-talkie that allows him to get in contact with Detective Lee Jae Han who is in the past. Police officers Hae Yeong, Jae Han, and Cha So Hyun then set out on a journey to solve cold cases.
