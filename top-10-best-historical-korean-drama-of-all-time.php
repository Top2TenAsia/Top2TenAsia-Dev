          This drama is highly recommended to me from my chingus on instagram. Empress Ki story revolves around Gi Seungnyang, a women born in Goryeo who get into the power despite the restrictions on her due to the era's class system, and later she marries Toghon Temür (Emperor of Mongol Empire) in order to become the empress of the Yuan dynasty for the power and wealth. She makes the huge sacrifice of leaving her first love, Wang Yu in order to become the empress.<br>

         A 25-year-old 21st-century woman, Go Ha-jin, is transported back in time to the Goryeo Dynasty. She wakes up in the year of 941 in Goreyo inside the body of a girl named Hae Soo which looks the same as her, who is a part of the family of the 8th prince of Goreyo.  She initially falls in love with the gentle and warm-hearted 8th Prince Wang Wook (Kang Ha-neul), and later Wang So, the fearsome 4th Prince who hides his face behind a mask and due to which he is known as "wolf dog." As the story moves further, Hae Soo finds herself caught between the rivalry and politics among the princes who fight for the throne.
